Exploring Weather Trends

In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

my goal will is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. To do this, I followed the steps below:

1) Extract the data from the database: I wrote a SQL query to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live, I wrote a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV. I wrotea SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
2) I open up the CSV in Excel. I created a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures using moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
3) I made  observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends. I answered questions like: 
Is my city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
“How do the changes in my city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
